 # AWS IAM
<h2>Identity and Access Management</h2>

AWS IAM is way of creating an identity or a user and grouping them into groups or leaving them, making sure they are on a premission policy on what service to use in AWS. What I meant was that with IAM, you can create groups and then
create users within such groups. Each user can be in multiple groups and each one of them have a permission policy on form of a JSON format. This JSON format states what service is AWS they have permission to use and how to use them.
Making use of an AWS IAM account is better than using your root user account as this is more secure to use.
But you cannot add groups in groups.
The root user sohuld be only used for creating an IAM user but not be used for any other thing or shared.
the users are people in an organization and they are part of a group
Groups only contain users but not other groups
Users may not be in any group and they can also be in multiple groups

# Beginning of AWS
<h2>AWS history</h2>
<p>AWS dated back to amazon e-commerce company where they felt the strength of their server infratrusture in 2002 and started innternally, It was in 2003 they realized they could make things such as IT for other people. In 2004, the AWS came up with a plan to create Amazon SQS and then upgraded to S3, EC2 in 2006. Now back today as they have taken over 47% of the cloud industry and have generated over 38 billion dollars in revenue, with Microsoft Azure being behind them taking up over 22% of the market</p>

<img src="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/images/wellarchitected/latest/high-performance-computing-lens/images/image4.png"/>

<p>
  After controlling the market, they scattered a lot of regions and availability zones across the planet to ensure their services are worldwide and the issue of latency is a no no.

# AWS ACCESSIBILITY
<h2>To make use of AWS we need to be able to access it</h2>

<h3>Well we have three ways of accesing AWS, which are as follows</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Using the standard AWS console</li>
  <li>Using the AWS CLI(Command Line Interface) either on your device or the AWS CloudShell</li>
  <li>Using the AWS SDK </li>
</ul>

![aws_cloud_shell](https://github.com/Ham12-3/aws_cloud_developer_associate/assets/93613316/d2c556d0-ce9f-4902-a360-0ff44f93763a)

To use the amazon CLI you'll need to get your CLI installed from AWS website then after that, you'll configure your access keys.
Try to make sure your access keys secrets are not revealed to someone else.
then you type in the code below 
```
aws --version
```

This is to check if your CLI installed successfully

Then after that you'll configure AWS, using the following command:
```
aws configure
```

# The Amazon Application Load Balancer (ALB) is a managed service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that helps you distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, or IP addresses. Think of it as a sophisticated traffic cop for your cloud applications, ensuring smooth flow and preventing bottlenecks.



Here's how the ALB works:

* **Distributes traffic:** When a user visits your website or uses your application, their request hits the ALB. The ALB then intelligently routes the request to one of your available targets, ensuring everyone gets served quickly and efficiently.
* **Scales on demand:** As your traffic fluctuates, the ALB automatically scales up or down its resources to handle the load. This means you avoid paying for idle capacity during low traffic periods, and your users never experience slowdowns during peak times.
* **Enhances security:** The ALB offers built-in DDoS protection and TLS encryption to safeguard your applications from malicious attacks and protect sensitive data.
* **Provides insights:** The ALB offers detailed monitoring and reporting tools, giving you visibility into your traffic patterns and application health. This information helps you identify and troubleshoot issues before they impact your users.

**Key benefits of using the ALB:**

* **Improved performance:** Reduces website loading times and enhances user experience.
* **Increased scalability:** Adapts to fluctuating traffic without manual intervention.
* **Enhanced security:** Protects your applications from attacks and data breaches.
* **Simplified management:** Provides a centralized platform for managing your application infrastructure.
* **Reduced costs:** Pay only for the resources you use, thanks to automatic scaling.

**Who can benefit from the ALB?**

* **Web developers:** Distribute traffic across web servers to ensure optimal performance.
* **App developers:** Scale mobile and web applications effortlessly.
* **DevOps engineers:** Streamline application management and automate scaling.
* **Anyone running cloud applications:** Improve performance, security, and scalability.

**In simple terms, the ALB is like having a highly trained traffic control center for your applications.** It keeps traffic flowing smoothly, protects your applications from harm, and gives you full visibility into what's happening. This makes it a valuable tool for any organization running applications in the cloud.

I hope this explanation clarifies what the Amazon ALB is and how it can benefit you. If you have any further questions, feel free to ask!


![3ga8w5y7gv9q4xukct62](https://github.com/Ham12-3/aws_cloud_developer_associate/assets/93613316/589bd94a-57c0-4ffa-98eb-fcb9d6d88c52)


**Empowering Scalability and Reliability with Amazon Web Service Load Balancers**

In the ever-evolving realm of web services, ensuring your application can gracefully handle varying levels of traffic is not just desirable but imperative. The ability to maintain performance and availability under fluctuating loads is a hallmark of a robust digital infrastructure. Enter Amazon Web Service (AWS) Load Balancers â€“ a suite of tools designed to distribute incoming traffic across multiple targets efficiently. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve deep into the world of AWS Load Balancers, exploring their types, connections, routing mechanisms, health checks, SSL/TLS capabilities, Server Name Indication (SNI), cross-zone load balancing, target groups, and more.

### Types of AWS Load Balancers

AWS offers three main types of Load Balancers, each tailored to specific use cases:

1. **Classic Load Balancer (CLB):** The traditional choice for basic load balancing across multiple EC2 instances. Operating at Layer 4 (Transport layer) of the OSI model, CLB makes routing decisions based on IP addresses and TCP ports. While it lacks some of the advanced features of its counterparts, it remains a viable option for simple applications.

  

2. **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Engineered for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, ALB operates at Layer 7 (Application layer), allowing for advanced routing based on content, URL, and HTTP headers. This makes ALB an ideal choice for modern web applications composed of multiple microservices.



3. **Network Load Balancer (NLB):** Positioned for extreme performance and low-latency requirements, NLB operates at Layer 4 like CLB but with enhanced capabilities. It efficiently handles millions of requests per second, making it suitable for high-throughput applications and scenarios demanding minimal latency.


### Connection and Routing Mechanisms

At the core of Load Balancers lie their ability to manage incoming traffic and distribute it across multiple targets. Load Balancers utilize algorithms such as round-robin or least connections to evenly spread the load among available targets. ALB and NLB take this a step further by offering sophisticated routing capabilities, enabling you to route requests based on various parameters like host, path, query string, and headers.

### Health Checks for Ensured Availability

Health checks play a pivotal role in maintaining the availability of targets. Load Balancers periodically send requests to registered targets, evaluating their health based on responses received. Unhealthy targets are automatically removed from the pool, ensuring that incoming traffic is directed only to healthy instances. This proactive approach to health monitoring enhances the overall availability of the application.

### SSL/TLS Encryption and SNI Support

In an era where data security is paramount, Load Balancers provide robust support for SSL/TLS encryption. By terminating SSL/TLS connections at the Load Balancer, the burden of encryption/decryption is lifted from backend servers, thus optimizing their performance. Moreover, ALB and NLB support Server Name Indication (SNI), enabling hosting multiple SSL certificates on a single IP address. This facilitates secure connections for multiple domains without the need for dedicated IP addresses.

### Cross-Zone Load Balancing for Enhanced Fault Tolerance

By default, Load Balancers distribute traffic evenly across registered targets within the same Availability Zone. However, enabling cross-zone load balancing ensures that traffic is evenly distributed across all available zones, thereby enhancing fault tolerance and improving overall application performance. This distributed approach mitigates the impact of potential failures in a single zone, enhancing the resilience of the infrastructure.

### Target Groups for Fine-Grained Traffic Control

Target Groups serve as logical groupings of targets registered with a Load Balancer. ALB and NLB leverage target groups to route requests to specific sets of targets based on defined routing rules. This granular control over traffic distribution enables features such as path-based routing and weighted target groups, allowing for optimized resource utilization and improved application performance.

### Conclusion

Amazon Web Service Load Balancers represent a cornerstone of modern cloud architectures, offering unparalleled scalability, reliability, and advanced routing capabilities. Whether you're managing a simple web application or a complex microservices ecosystem, Load Balancers empower you to maintain high availability and optimal performance under varying workloads. By leveraging features such as SSL termination, advanced routing, and health checks, businesses can build resilient and scalable applications on AWS infrastructure, thereby driving continuous innovation and growth in today's digital landscape.

In conclusion, embracing AWS Load Balancers enables organizations to navigate the complexities of modern web services with confidence, ensuring robustness, scalability, and reliability in the face of evolving demands and challenges.


## Imagine a group of friends... but for your cloud servers!

Think of an **Amazon Auto Scaling Group** as a team of virtual servers working together to handle your application's workload, just like a group of friends helping each other with a task. Each server is like a friend, and the group scales up or down automatically based on your needs.

Here's how it works:

**1. You set the desired number of servers in the group:** This is like deciding how many friends you need to help with the task.

**2. Servers automatically spin up or down:** If your website traffic suddenly increases, new servers are added to the group like more friends pitching in. Conversely, if things quiet down, some servers can take a break or even leave the group.

**3. Servers are always healthy and working:** Just like reliable friends, Amazon Auto Scaling continuously monitors the health of each server and replaces any unhealthy ones quickly, ensuring your application keeps running smoothly.

**4. You pay only for what you use:** This is like splitting the bill among your friends. You only pay for the servers that are actually working, not for the ones on standby.

**Benefits of using Amazon Auto Scaling Groups:**

* **Cost-effective:** No more overpaying for unused resources.
* **Highly available:** Your application stays up and running even during traffic spikes.
* **Scalable:** Easily handle changing demand without manual intervention.
* **Manageable:** Simplify your infrastructure management and focus on your application.

**Here's an analogy to help you visualize:**

* **Think of your website as a restaurant.** During peak hours, you need more waiters (servers) to handle the influx of customers. But during off-peak hours, you don't need as many. Amazon Auto Scaling is like having a team of waiters who automatically show up when needed and disappear when they're not, saving you money on labor costs.

**In short, Amazon Auto Scaling Groups take the guesswork out of server scaling, giving you a reliable and cost-effective way to handle fluctuating demand for your cloud resources.**

**What is DNS?**

Imagine the internet as a vast city with millions of buildings (websites). Each building has a street address (IP address), but we navigate using names (domain names). DNS is like the city's phone book, translating human-readable names (e.g., bard.ai) into their corresponding addresses (e.g., 93.184.216.34).

**How does it work?**

When you type a domain name, your computer sends a query to a network of servers called DNS resolvers. These resolvers then consult with other servers until they find the correct IP address for the website you requested. Once they have it, they send it back to your computer, and your browser can connect to the website.

**Why is DNS important?**

* **Speed:** DNS significantly reduces the time it takes to load websites by eliminating the need to search for IP addresses manually.
* **Accuracy:** It ensures you're always reaching the correct website, avoiding phishing scams and malicious websites.
* **Security:** Some DNS resolvers offer additional security features like malware filtering and parental controls.
* **Efficiency:** Without DNS, the internet would be a much slower and more confusing place.

**Fun facts about DNS:**

* There are millions of DNS servers around the world, working together 24/7 to keep the internet running smoothly.
* The first DNS server was created in 1983!
* Some countries have their own top-level domains, like .cn for China or .fr for France.
* You can actually change your DNS server to improve your internet speed or security.

# Connectng AWS EC2 instance with Route53
**Understanding the Purpose:**

* **Domain Name System (DNS):** Translates human-readable domain names (e.g., [www.example.com](https://www.example.com)) into machine-readable IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1), enabling users to access websites and web applications.
* **Route 53:** AWS's highly available and scalable cloud DNS service.
* **EC2 Instance:** A virtual server in AWS's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) service, hosting websites, applications, and other resources.

**Benefits of Connecting EC2 Instance with Route 53:**

* **Simplified Domain Routing:** Point your domain name to your EC2 instance's IP address within Route 53, eliminating reliance on external DNS providers.
* **High Availability:** Route 53's distributed DNS servers ensure domain accessibility even during outages.
* **Scalability:** Handles increased traffic with ease.
* **Enhanced Security:** DNSSEC for domain protection.
* **AWS Integration:** Seamless integration with other AWS services.

**Prerequisites:**

* An AWS account with an active EC2 instance.
* A registered domain name that you control.

**General Steps:**

1. **Access Route 53:** Locate Route 53 within your AWS Management Console.
2. **Create Hosted Zone:** Establish a hosted zone for your domain name.
3. **Obtain EC2 Instance IP Address:** Find the public IP address of your EC2 instance.
4. **Create A Record:** Within the hosted zone, create an A record mapping your domain name to the EC2 instance's IP address.
5. **Propagation Delay:** Allow time for DNS changes to propagate globally (typically up to 48 hours).

**Additional Considerations:**

* **Elastic IP Addresses:** Consider using Elastic IPs for static IP addresses that persist even if the instance is stopped or terminated.
* **Health Checks and Failover:** Route 53 offers health checks and failover routing for high availability.
* **Traffic Flow Management:** Route 53 can route traffic to multiple resources for load balancing or geolocation-based routing.
